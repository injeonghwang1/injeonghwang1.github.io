I am a sociologist with research interests in quantitative methods, family demography, work and family, caregiving, intergenerational relationship, aging, gender, child development, and health.
My research mainly focuses on uncovering nuanced ways in which gendered ideological conditioning manifests in domestic responsibilities and reinforces gender inequality at home and beyond. My projects leverage nationally representative panel and cross-sectional survey datasets, and I sometimes adjudicate multiple datasets within a project.
